## Overview

_.NET Bumper_ is a .NET Global Tool to upgrade projects to a newer version of .NET.

Bumper helps you upgrade your .NET projects to a newer version by taking

of .NET, _and_ the latest preview versions of .NET. üöÄ

- Updating the .NET SDK version in `global.json` üßë‚Äçüíª
- Upgrading the Target Framework of your project files ‚öôÔ∏è
- Upgrading .NET, ASP.NET Core and EFCore NuGet packages to the appropriate versions üì¶
- Updating image tags in Dockerfiles üê≥
- Running `dotnet test` to validate the upgrade üß™
